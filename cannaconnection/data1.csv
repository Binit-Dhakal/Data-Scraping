There is hardly a smoker or cannabis grower who doesn’t know about this legendary strain. The sativa-dominant AK-47 as we know now was created by Simon from Serious Seeds in 1992. Its origin goes back much further to the 70s where it probably begun as a cross between Thai and Afghani.In 1999, AK-47 was re-crossed so it produced more uniform seeds.Some may wonder where AK-47 got its name from. The strain is named after the famous Russian Kalashnikov rifle, but not so much because it would be a “violent” strain. Its high, while very powerful is actually very balanced. The strain got this name since it can literally knock out some less experienced smokers with just one hit. That's why Simon gave this strain the nickname ""One Hit Wonder"".AK-47 is one of the most awarded cannabis strains in history. It has won many Cannabis Cup awards thanks to its very high THC content of more than 20%. You can find it on many lists of recommended “Top Cannabis Strains"" as the strain that every grower and smoker should at least try once.AK-47 produces dark, very juicy and compact buds with an intense, spicy skunk-like aroma. You can smell hints of pine, sandalwood and some lighter citrus tones. Her smoke has a robust, strong and refreshing citrus flavor with some deeper skunk undertones.AK-47 delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. Its high is nicely balanced and can relax and energize at the same time.This is a strain that can help relieve anxiety, depression, chronic pains and stress. They don’t call it a “one hit wonder” without a reason. Its high can be very powerful so that less experienced users should take it slow when they meet AK-47 for their first time.Its outstanding high and good yields make her also the favorite of many cannabis growers. Yet, her beauty and exceptionally aromatic buds come at a price.It is one of the most intensively smelling and odourful plants to grow. Growers of the strain will need to take good care of odour control and want adequate air circulation. With her juicy and very resinous buds, she's also more prone to mold as compared to some other strains.Aside from that, she's easy to grow. It will only reach a medium height so that it is suitable for many types of grows. It can grow well if grown in soil or hydroponically.Although she will also grow outdoors, she prefers a milder climate. With temperatures above 25°C, AK-47 will still give the same yield of up to 500g/m², but her buds become less dense and somewhat fluffy. This is the reason why most growers like to grow her indoors in a controlled setting.The flowering time of AK-47 is eight to nine weeks, which is pretty short for a sativa-dominant cannabis strain.",Easy ,Photoperiod,8-9 weeks,Mid/end October,350-500g/m²,Medium,Medium,Medium,"

You're more likely going to want to curl up in front of the TV with a bag of crisps.Hindu Kush is also excellent at triggering appetite, for those who have a hard time eating. Often times, patients suffering from the negative effects of cancer treatments have opted to try cannabis to relieve those symptoms. While still the subject of debate, those who have turned to heavy indica strains like Hindu Kush have stated that with just a few hits, they were able to eat again and return to a more normal routine. Between her incredible flavour, the overwhelming relaxation, and bursts of creativity, Hindu Kush has more than earned its place among the best cannabis strains in the world.Hindu Kush also has a reputation for being beginner-grower friendly. It is resistant to changes in temperature and overall climate, so you know it won't cause you a lot of problems. On average, Hindu Kush will reach a height of one to one and a half meters and can produce as much as 400 grams per plant. Hindu Kush is a strain that grows well using the sea of green (or SoG) method of cultivation.Sea of green jump starts flowering by ending your veg stage early, after only one or two weeks. This will keep your Hindu Kush at a manageable height. By pushing your pots close together, you will end up with a canopy of thick colas, maximizing your yield.Hindu Kush is known for being a resin heavy plant. It is believed that many of the first hashes were made from Hindu Kush and similar genetics. The result is a very sticky and dense bud that will bulk up and line your central stalk, forming one huge cola. The buds are typically dark green and coated with heavy crystals, spreading out onto the tasty sugar leaf.Your garden will take on a somewhat musty smell, with unusually sweet overtone. Many compare the odor of Hindu Kush to spice or a wet pine smell.If you are new to cultivation and are worrying about messing things up, don't. Not only is Hindu Kush able to be grown in a less than ideal environments, it can handle being a little out of range on the pH meter. As far as your feed schedule goes, like most other strains, Hindu Kush should be hit in the vegetative stage with a feed mixture that runs an EC of around 2.3.As the plant moves into its flowering stage, you can adjust your EC if and when needed. Maintain your plants' nutrient levels, and watch out for pests. You'll be ready to kick back with your glorious bounty in right around eight weeks.Besides being one of the oldest known strains, and being particularly good for new growers to work with, it has been the winner of numerous Cannabis Cup competitions over the years. One of the first breeders to bring their Hindu Kush to fame and victory was the world famous Sensi Seeds, who took first place in the 2006 Copa De Asturias. Since then numerous Hindu Kush phenotypes have found their way into competitions and new genetic offspring around the world.",Easy,Photoperiod,7 weeks,End of September/October,Medium,Medium,Short,Short,"

This buzzy high is perfect for daytime use during work, tasks, and especially when engaging in a creative project such as writing music or designing.

The strain is known for causing dry mouth, so be sure to keep a bottle of water or juice nearby to counter this.Green Crack is a relatively easy strain of cannabis to grow and therefore may serve as a great choice for novice growers who are just starting out. Green Crack stays below 200cm in height which means it is easy to manage and can be grown in limited space. The flowering period of the grow cycle lasts between 9 weeks in duration.",Medium,Photoperiod,9 weeks,October,Medium,Medium,Medium,Medium,"

The hybrid strain Juicy Fruit was subsequently crossed with an Afghani landrace by DJ Short creating the first ever Blueberry around 1979.The buds and leaves of the new strain had a blue hue to them and it smelled of berries and fruit. DJ Short therefore aptly named her Blueberry. Even though the newly created strain consisted of at least 80% Afghani indica, it still had the original sativa effects of its ancestors.It wasn’t until the 1990’s that DJ Short decided to bring the genetics of his Blueberry to Europe by teaming up with Dutch Passion. A number of new hybrids were created, giving birth to Blue Satellite, Blue Moonshine and Blue Velvet.

Her incredibly sweet and fruity taste with floral hints is reminiscent of blueberries and forest fruits.The Blueberry offers a long lasting body stoned that is very relaxing but it also gives the user mild feelings of euphoria, relieving stress and providing an uplifting high. It is medicinally used as a painkiller, an anti-depressant, to help with anxiety and to promote better sleep.Blueberry might be difficult when it comes to fertilizing; she can be quite the picky feeder, so pay close attention to her. Under ideal circumstances and in the hands of experienced growers however, she will reward you with a grade A harvest. Grown indoors, this fruity strain will reach a height of around 50 to 100cm and has an 8 to 9 weeks flowering time.Most growers like to germinate several seeds at once and select the best seedling to become a mother plant. It is very easy to multiply Blueberry by taking cuttings and effectively cloning the mother plant. By using a mother plant and continuously taking cuttings from it, a grower has a steady supply of Blueberry clones to harvest from.Blueberry has been a celebrated strain.
