There is hardly a smoker or cannabis grower who doesn\u2019t know about this legendary strain. The sativa-dominant AK-47 as we know now was created by Simon from Serious Seeds in 1992. Its origin goes back much further to the 70s where it probably begun as a cross between Thai and Afghani.In 1999, AK-47 was re-crossed so it produced more uniform seeds.Some may wonder where AK-47 got its name from. The strain is named after the famous Russian Kalashnikov rifle, but not so much because it would be a \u201cviolent\u201d strain. Its high, while very powerful is actually very balanced. The strain got this name since it can literally knock out some less experienced smokers with just one hit. That's why Simon gave this strain the nickname \"One Hit Wonder\".AK-47 is one of the most awarded cannabis strains in history. It has won many Cannabis Cup awards thanks to its very high THC content of more than 20%. You can find it on many lists of recommended \u201cTop Cannabis Strains\" as the strain that every grower and smoker should at least try once.AK-47 produces dark, very juicy and compact buds with an intense, spicy skunk-like aroma. You can smell hints of pine, sandalwood and some lighter citrus tones. Her smoke has a robust, strong and refreshing citrus flavor with some deeper skunk undertones.AK-47 delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. Its high is nicely balanced and can relax and energize at the same time.This is a strain that can help relieve anxiety, depression, chronic pains and stress.

Yet, her beauty and exceptionally aromatic buds come at a price.It is one of the most intensively smelling and odourful plants to grow. Growers of the strain will need to take good care of odour control and want adequate air circulation. With her juicy and very resinous buds, she's also more prone to mold as compared to some other strains.Aside from that, she's easy to grow. It will only reach a medium height so that it is suitable for many types of grows. It can grow well if grown in soil or hydroponically.Although she will also grow outdoors, she prefers a milder climate. With temperatures above 25\u00b0C, AK-47 will still give the same yield of up to 500g/m\u00b2, but her buds become less dense and somewhat fluffy.

However, about halfway into the experience most users experience a slight shift into a more indica-like experience. This is usually characterized by deep body relaxation and an overall sense of calm.

Hindu Kush is one of the oldest strains, known to have been consumed by early mankind, that is still around to this very day. Hindu Kush got its name from the mountain range that cuts through Pakistan and Afghanistan, also known as the Hindu Kush mountains. Although it is a pure indica landrace strain, years of inbreeding have resulted in stable genetics that are easy to manage and will flourish in both indoor and outdoor grows.Hindu Kush is a potent strain that carries with it all the indica traits you could ever want. With just the first hit, you're hit with a brilliant sensation of relaxation. The moderate amounts of CBD flow throughout your body, leaving every last inch of you with a resonating body high. It may take a minute for the THC, which in Hindu Kush can be upwards of 20%, to find its way to your CB1 receptors, but when it does, you'll know it.The buzz has been described as heavy, which can cause a gravitational reaction between you and your pillow. One of the more beneficial effects of Hindu Kush is that along with a total body realization experience comes a washing away of all the aches and pains that troubled you throughout the day.The sweet and almost fruity flavours of Hindu Kush go hand in hand with the relaxing and euphoric feelings one will experience with just a small hit. Hindu Kush is also known for inspiring creativity. Artists and musicians will enjoy Hindu Kush for its ability to transport the user to higher dimensions of thought, barely tethering the mind to the body.Your body, however, will be hard to ignore when the hairs on your arms stand up from tingling going on under the skin. This isn't a strain you're going to want to use if you're heading out for a hike, or a game of football with your mates. You're more likely going to want to curl up in front of the TV with a bag of crisps.Hindu Kush is also excellent at triggering appetite, for those who have a hard time eating. Often times, patients suffering from the negative effects of cancer treatments have opted to try cannabis to relieve those symptoms. While still the subject of debate, those who have turned to heavy indica strains like Hindu Kush have stated that with just a few hits, they were able to eat again and return to a more normal routine. Between her incredible flavour, the overwhelming relaxation, and bursts of creativity, Hindu Kush has more than earned its place among the best cannabis strains in the world.Hindu Kush also has a reputation for being beginner-grower friendly. It is resistant to changes in temperature and overall climate, so you know it won't cause you a lot of problems. On average, Hindu Kush will reach a height of one to one and a half meters and can produce as much as 400 grams per plant. Hindu Kush is a strain that grows well using the sea of green (or SoG) method of cultivation.Sea of green jump starts flowering by ending your veg stage early, after only one or two weeks. This will keep your Hindu Kush at a manageable height. By pushing your pots close together, you will end up with a canopy of thick colas, maximizing your yield.Hindu Kush is known for being a resin heavy plant. It is believed that many of the first hashes were made from Hindu Kush and similar genetics. The result is a very sticky and dense bud that will bulk up and line your central stalk, forming one huge cola. The buds are typically dark green and coated with heavy crystals, spreading out onto the tasty sugar leaf.Your garden will take on a somewhat musty smell, with unusually sweet overtone. Many compare the odor of Hindu Kush to spice or a wet pine smell.If you are new to cultivation and are worrying about messing things up, don't. Not only is Hindu Kush able to be grown in a less than ideal environments, it can handle being a little out of range on the pH meter. As far as your feed schedule goes, like most other strains, Hindu Kush should be hit in the vegetative stage with a feed mixture that runs an EC of around 2.3.As the plant moves into its flowering stage, you can adjust your EC if and when needed. Maintain your plants' nutrient levels, and watch out for pests. You'll be ready to kick back with your glorious bounty in right around eight weeks.Besides being one of the oldest known strains, and being particularly good for new growers to work with, it has been the winner of numerous Cannabis Cup competitions over the years. One of the first breeders to bring their Hindu Kush to fame and victory was the world famous Sensi Seeds, who took first place in the 2006 Copa De Asturias.

The hybrid strain Juicy Fruit was subsequently crossed with an Afghani landrace by DJ Short creating the first ever Blueberry around 1979.The buds and leaves of the new strain had a blue hue to them and it smelled of berries and fruit. DJ Short therefore aptly named her Blueberry. Even though the newly created strain consisted of at least 80% Afghani indica, it still had the original sativa effects of its ancestors.It wasn\u2019t until the 1990\u2019s that DJ Short decided to bring the genetics of his Blueberry to Europe by teaming up with Dutch Passion. A number of new hybrids were created, giving birth to Blue Satellite, Blue Moonshine and Blue Velvet. The Blueberry strain hasn\u2019t gone out of style since and has remained a staple with many coffee shops and growers ever since.Named Blueberry because of the blue hues in its leaves and buds, this strain is not only beautiful but also very potent. She holds 19.5% to 21% THC, so it packs a punch, but it is still easy on the throat when smoked and goes down smoothly. Her incredibly sweet and fruity taste with floral hints is reminiscent of blueberries and forest fruits.The Blueberry offers a long lasting body stoned that is very relaxing but it also gives the user mild feelings of euphoria, relieving stress and providing an uplifting high. It is medicinally used as a painkiller, an anti-depressant, to help with anxiety and to promote better sleep.Blueberry might be difficult when it comes to fertilizing; she can be quite the picky feeder, so pay close attention to her.

By using a mother plant and continuously taking cuttings from it, a grower has a steady supply of Blueberry clones to harvest from.Blueberry has been a celebrated strain.

Durban Poison derives from the original Durban, which was hybridized with indica genetics. Durban Poison is a famous strain, many seedbanks may have their own versions of this sativa. Let\u2019s check out what Durban Poison has to offer.The taste of Durban Poison is quite unique. The classic fruity Haze-like aromas are present, in addition to the spicy, anise and licorice scents, which add character to this sativa. The highs are considered as highly energetic, and uplifting. If one wishes to go hiking with mates or enjoy surfing, Durban Poison is a cool strain for these activities. Durban Poison consumers also noted great focus after hitting that toke. Artists and creative humans can find inspiration and focus from this cultivar.In the beginning, Durban Poison looks like an indica, comprising wide leaves. Although, at the end of the flowering period, one notices the sativa dominance. Growers praise this cultivar for its protective and resilient nature. Durban Poison can reach approximately 2-3m, a classic sativa move. Experienced indoor growers can grow this strain, by using ScrOG methods, and string support techniques.

For many, the discovery of this strain is what made it clear that it was time to change our opinions about cannabis and its uses.The strain was developed in 2011 by the Stanley Brothers (Joel, Jesse, Jon, Jordan, Jared and Austin) from Colorado, USA. To create this strain they crossed a marijuana strain with an industrial hemp strain. This way they were able to obtain a strain with a high CBD percentage, but practically no THC.The strain is named after Charlotte Figi, a young girl (born in 2006) who suffers from an Dravet syndrome, a severe type of epilepsy that doesn\u2019t respond to any kind of standard medication or treatment. Charlotte was only 3 months old when she experienced her first seizure which was said to last roughly 30 minutes. She soon began experiencing seizures more frequently, some lasting up to 2 hours. At her worst, Charlotte was experiencing roughly 300 seizures a week.However, all that changed once she started her treatment with medical cannabis. Within her first week of treatment, Charlotte suffered no seizures at all. The medicine she receives is an extract made from Charlotte\u2019s Web and is rich in CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid which accounts for roughly 40% of the plants extract.Her story and the use of CBD got featured in a 2013 documentary from CNN called \"Weed\". Since then a lot has happened. Recent scientific studies have shown CBD shows great promise in helping patients like Charlotte find relief from their symptoms.In December 2015, Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist at New York University Langone Medical Center, and a team of researchers conducted a study on the effect of CBD on patients with epilepsy.

Until this mutant breed came along the particular flavour range of Cheese was unheard of in cannabis culture.

Moulding can easily grow in this atmosphere and will ruin the entire plant if you cannot control the humidity.Another issue that you will need to pay close attention to is the fact that the branches can snap, due to the heavy weight of the bud.

Blending these strains together created a hybrid with a sweet and candy-like flavour that could only be captured in one name: Runtz.Then, in an effort to bring the goodness of Runtz to growers with less time and space, breeders combined it with a ruderalis strain, bringing Runtz Automatic to life.

The group travelled to South Africa in order to expand their genetic library and ended up using their bounty to create the strain Power Plant, an extremely popular strain within the weed tolerant city of Amsterdam. Power Flower is an attempt to recreate the best properties of this famous strain.Power Flower produces a high that ignites the mind and relaxes the body. The sativa dominance of the strain ensures that the majority of the high is cerebral and exhilarating. The indica genetics within plants add a slight body high that is defined by sleepy and calming sensations. This balance of energetic relaxation makes the strain a multipurpose smoke that can be used at different times and for different reasons depending upon the mood of the smoker. When blazing blunts and bongs containing Power Flower smokers can expect to experience the contrasting flavours of sweet and sour attacking their taste buds from all angles.

A purple power house called Purple Afghan Kush. Purple Afghan Kush is as beautiful as it is relaxing. This strain naturally contains deep blue and purple hues, not because of temperature, but because of the specific combination of genetics. Purple Afghan Kush is an indica-dominant strain, whose lineage and distinct color have made it a popular choice among cannabis connoisseurs.This particular hybrid comes from the legendary Emerald Triangle region of Northern California, an area, that got its name from the three heaviest producing cannabis counties in the US and possibly the world. While not a pure indica, it tends to hold about an 80/20 ratio for most phenotypes, and has all the characteristics you would expect. Relaxing, soothing, and possessing an incredible fruity flavor, Afghan Purple Kush will catch the attention of all your mates with its amazing color, potency, and delicious flavors.The sweet and fruity aroma given off by Purple Afghan Kush goes well with the incredibly calm and peaceful effects of consuming it. The one thing, that everyone can agree on, is the heavily fruit-laden terpenes, that permeate the strain. What people can't agree on, is what fruit it tastes like. Some say pineapples, some say grapes, and some say good old fashioned apples. Either way, if sweet aromatic flavors are your thing, Purple Afghan Kush may be right up your alley.Indicas have a reputation for being the relaxing \u201cstoner\u201d type of marijuana. This strain in particular is great at maintaining the indica stereotype, with a heavy body buzz and a more soothing head high. I wouldn't try to run a marathon after giving Purple Afghan Kush a try. Odds are you are going to want to take a swing in a hammock, or doze off while listening to some music. THC content has tested at a range of between 15 and 21 percent, and while it doesn't contain an abundance of CBD, coming in at around 1-1.5%, it has just the right balance of cannabinoids to relieve whatever is ailing you.As with many other indicas, people have found, that Purple Afghan Kush is an incredible alternative to popping pills to take care of your aches and pains. Purple Afghan Kush has been one of many strains, that have incredible relief properties. People have used this strain to overcome a number of chronic ailments, including muscle spasms, nausea and the pain of arthritis.Another incredible property of Purple Afghan Kush is, that it is higher in CBN than most strains, or cannabinol. CBN's primary effect on the body is to cause muscles to relax. It is also great at quelling anxiety, which makes Purple Afghan Kush a great strain for those who want to get elevated without having to deal with becoming overwhelmed.Before you get started, know that Purple Afghan Kush is used to thriving in drier and hotter conditions than normal. If you're concerned about overwatering, be sure to throw some perlite into your soil, to help keep your plants a little drier.Being from an arid climate, you'll want to keep your humidity down, as higher humidity levels will surely choke your plants and their progress. This isn't an overly difficult strain to grow, but keeping an eye on the basics, like your climate, is a must. If cared for properly, purple afghan kush can produce quantities of up to 500 grams per square meter, or as much as 800 grams per plant outdoors.You can grow Purple Afghan Kush outdoors or in a greenhouse, however, if you do, you need to make sure you are not overwatering or allowing the weather to affect your grow. Your best bet is to give this a shot indoors, where you can better monitor and adjust the climate to meet the plant's drier needs.Purple Afghan Kush doesn't get too tall, typically staying at or under one meter in height when grown indoors. Size-wise, it is known for adapting to its environment. Outdoors it can reach heights of over two meters. It has a tendency to be bushy, especially if topped more than once.The buds will be a dark green early on in the flowering phase, however, they will lose chlorophyll and take on a distinct purple hue as you get closer to harvest. Buds along the central stalk will not form a single dense cola, instead there will be some spacing between the nodes, reminiscent of a Girl Scout Cookie or similar strain.Purple Afghan Kush by Dinafem Seeds took home the first place prize for \u201cBest Indica\u201d at the 2015 Expogrow.

A potent hybrid, that had incredible flavor and was easy to grow, White Widow quickly became a popular strain among consumers and growers alike. It first made its appearance in the cannabis scene in the mid-nineties, and has gone on to obtain legendary status among cannabis consumers around the world.Its true origins are only suspected, as many have claimed to have been the first to breed White widow. What is suspected, is that the first White Widow came from the Green House Seed Company and master grower Shantibaba. It is also believed, that the first White Widow was a cross between two landrace strains; a Brazilian sativa and an Indian indica, however, the uncertainty behind the original parents has left White Widow shrouded in mystery.White Widow flowers into dense, pale green buds, with their famous white coating of trichomes spreading out onto the surrounding leaves. The appearance is hard to overlook, as White Widow tends to stand out in any grow. As a stable cross of landrace genetics, White Widow is resistant to swings in climate and can thrive with less care than most other strains, making it a great choice for your garden if you are just starting to develop your green thumb.The smell of White Widow is incredibly pungent and savory, with some piney undertones and just a hint of spice. Once smoked, the delicious flavor is sweet and fruity, and it leaves behind a slightly sugary aftertaste. Despite White Widow\u2019s sweet flavor, it definitely packs a punch so coughing might be inevitable.Immediately after smoking, you will experience a burst of energy and euphoria leaving you feeling uplifted, conversational, and creative. If you have any anxiety or stress, you can kiss that goodbye after a few puffs of white widow.However, after a while the effects become heavier and you may end up stuck on the couch for a while if you\u2019re not already engaged in some sort of activity. Of course, whether or not you\u2019re couch locked depends on many factors: how you consume it (smoke, vape, edibles, etc.), your tolerance level, and how it\u2019s grown.Fortunately it doesn\u2019t take a master grower to be able to produce quality White Widow at home. If you are having trouble keeping your temperatures and humidity constant, White Window won\u2019t take it personally. Bred from landrace strains, that had to adapt to harsh and shifting climates, you will find, that White Widow wants to survive and will produce heavy yields, despite minor obstacles.White Widow can be grown outdoors and will sprout up if allowed to. Indoors, she will grow into plants, that usually won\u2019t exceed a meter. Their short stature make them perfect for cultivating in the sea of green method. Sea of green focuses on short plants with thick dense center colas, that end up forming a thick canopy of buds in a small area. Known as a heavy yielder, you can collect as much as 500g/m\u00b2 indoors and up to 600 grams per plant outdoors or in a greenhouse.If you are looking to gain a little more size and weight out of White Widow, don\u2019t feel the need to cut the vegetation period short. Topping White Widow once, and allowing it to veg for a full four weeks will maximize the number of flowering sites and help put out an enormous yield.If you choose to plant these outside, you will want to have these in the ground early enough to harvest in mid-October. Indoors you can expect to go from flowering stage to harvest in eight weeks, although some recommend letting her go for another week or two, to maximize the trichome production, which White Widow is famous for.As long as you keep your EC, pH and climate within the suitable range for cannabis, White Widow doesn\u2019t need any particularly special care. It has learned to get by with less water than most cannabis plants, so if you are using coco or soil, it doesn\u2019t hurt to throw some perlite into the mix to increase airflow and allow excess water to be shed. In the end, White Widow is an incredibly potent strain, that is easy to grow and will satisfy even the most ardent connoisseur.It didn\u2019t take long for White Widow to take home a Cannabis Cup trophy. Only a year after it made its way onto the scene, White Widow took home the first place trophy at the High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995.

Skunk XL is a balanced strain in that its genetic makeup is 50 percent indica and 50 percent sativa. This strain has been worked on over many years in order to refine its sweet tastes and large flowers.When smoking this strain smokers can expect to experience the balance between indica and sativa genetics that is represented by Skunk XL. The strain causes a rather strong body high that ignites the usual relaxing and calming effects always associated with indica strains. In contrast, the sativa elements of the strain compliment the stone by adding a slightly energetic and cerebral touch into the mix. This combination makes for a strain that is both powerfully stoning yet functional and motivating.Skunk XL is a hardy, durable and adaptive strain. This impressive and desirable quality means the strain can tolerate harsher conditions than range for mild to cold climates. This means the plant can be successfully grown in outdoor regions that span as far north of areas of the UK and Holland.When grown indoors in a grow tent or empty room, Skunk XL can reach heights of up to 1 meter and will produce significant yields in this environment. When Skunk XL is grown outdoors in a decent climate within garden beds or guerilla grow locations, the strain can literally double in size and gain heights of 2 metres. When grown in a favourable climate, outdoors yields are typically bigger due to an increase in size.The flowering period of Skunk XL lasts between 7 to 8 weeks and produces buds with a THC content of 17 percent.

Haze, Northern Lights #5 and Skunk #1. Each an intoxicating example in themselves of expert marijuana breeding.Super Silver Haze has a psychedelic double dipping of strong tropical sativas in its genealogy. There is also a noticeable influence of the Afghan indica in her story. Certainly sativa-dominant, Super Silver Haze is one the most indica influenced of the Hazes in maturing time, internode distance and bud compactness.21% THC makes Super Silver Haze a favourite for making hash and extracts. The leaves are so well covered in trichomes, that trimming them is purely for commercial aesthetics. So, even the trim makes A-grade hash providing plenty of available essential oils and rich cannabinoids.Super silver haze is known to have a powerful, sweet, and somewhat spicy aroma. The sweet skunk smell combined with the earthy haze and stark Afghani scents from the Northern Lights all combine magically together. It tastes pretty much the way it smells, fantastic! With its bold yet sweet-tasting smoke, it\u2019s no surprise why this is a very popular strain.The buzz from Super Silver Haze is a functioning, daytime high. You\u2019ll be full of energy, but still feel peaceful, centred, and clear-headed. It\u2019s the perfect type of strain for a nice wake and bake session. Not to mention, Super Silver Haze is great for treating headaches/migraines, and anxiety.Outdoors: If you have unlimited root space or maximum sized grow bags, make sure you have plenty of room, because Super Silver Haze will boom if given the opportunity. Properly topped and trained, a three metre diameter ball of dense vegetation can be created ready for autumn and flowering.A ladder will need to be added to any growers hardware list if going to grow Super Silver Haze outdoors. The sativa-dominant genetic wants to stretch and stretch some more and can double its height and volume during the flowering phase. It is exciting in the early weeks of flowering, as the plant differentiates and it can be seen how many flower sites there are going to be.Beguiling scents are produced immediately when flowers start to appear. That first full moon flush of calyx puffballs add the distinctive Haze citrus flavour to the morning air. After nine or maybe eleven weeks, support cages, stakes and ties will be pushed to their limits to support resin drenched clusters of dense cannabis flowers.Indoors: Hungry, but fickle Super Silver Haze will respond to fertilization with sturdy, thriving growth, but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking you can accelerate things by feeding it more. It will all go bad overnight and you will wake to find heartbreaking bright yellow toxicity.The want of the sativa to go tall can be used by the artful scrogger to make a magic silver carpet of thick flowers two metres in diameter. Denying the plant a central cola makes it put equal effort into all the flowers. This way you can be rewarded with over 800g/m\u00b2 of homogeneous well-sized flower spindles varnished with silver candy floss.If you are being stealthy, you will have to pay particular attention to smell control.
